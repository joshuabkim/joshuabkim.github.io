		<h3>An aspiring software engineer</h3>

		<p>NEW JERSEY, &mdash; I graduated from Rutgers University with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and an academic minor in Mathematics. I've always been curious of why and how things worked in most systems. Which is why I am seeking an entry-level opportunity to learn the responsiblities and software design paradigms of a back end engineer. </p>

		<p>I am proficient in both C and Java due to much of my coursework concentrating on subjects like operating systems, computer architecture, and programming languages. I am also interested in developing an eclectic background&semi; Currently, I am learning and experimenting with front end tools and technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Furthermore, I enjoy reading books or listening to podcasts pertaining to behavioral economics.</p>

		<p>Most recently, I competed and won at my first hackathon hosted by <a class='hackathon' href='https://www.publicissapient.com/' target='_blank'>Publicis.Sapient</a>, where I built an intra-day profit/loss calculation and aggregation back-end module for a hypothetical Global Equities Desk. It was the first time I had a taste of collaboration and development in a software engineering environment.</p>
